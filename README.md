# New Password Generator 
>>>>>>> f6f607d (revised README file)

## Description 
I have been tasked to develop a password generator for new, safe, and effective passwords that provides greater security for the sensitive data of my company. It is a simple application where users are able to generate a password within 8-128 characters and include or not inlude criteria such as upper case, lower case, numebrs, and/or symbols. 
This application focuses primarily on javascript code although some html code was commented in order for any developer to understand how it correlates to the javascript and the outcome desired. 

## Installation
This page can be deployed using the github pages link found below in the usage section.

Information on how to do this can be found here:

## Usage 
When you open the deployed site link, a page appears with a blank text box surrounded with a gray dotted border. User is able to click the
button that says "generate password" in order to begin process. Upon clicking, users are able to select any password length between 8-128 characters. Anything outside of this will not be allow and an alert message will pop up prompting users once again to choose a length within the required parameters. The user then has several criteria to choose from to include in their new password. For example, they can choose wether they want: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Users have the option of including all, several, are one criteria only (It is recommended that users choose to include all criteria in order for maximum security potential). Users must select atleast one criteria to include in their password or else an alert message will appear. Finally, once all or desired criteria is chosen, a password will appear within the text box and users can now begin to use their unique password.
